The proliferation of intelligent sensors, the growing adoption of IoT devices and the integration of many intelligent applications call for questions about the amount of generated data and their processing. Defining a processing architecture tailored for effective management of a massive amount of data is a real challenge. What are the current good practices and trends? What about AI in this process? This seminar will allow you to understand the existing issues as well as some possible answers to this problem.
